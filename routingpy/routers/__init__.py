"""
Every routing service below has a separate module in ``routingpy.routers``, which hosts a class abstracting the service's
API. Each router has at least a ``directions`` method, many offer additionally ``matrix`` and/or ``isochrones`` methods.
Other available provider endpoints are allowed and generally encouraged. However, please refer
to our `contribution guidelines`_ for general instructions.

The requests are handled via a client class derived from :class:`routingpy.client_base.BaseClient`.

**routingpy**'s dogma is, that all routers expose the same mandatory arguments for common methods in an
attempt to be consistent for the same method across different routers. Unlike other collective libraries,
we additionally chose to preserve each router's special arguments, only abstracting the most basic arguments, such as
locations and profile (car, bike, pedestrian etc.), among others (full list here_).
