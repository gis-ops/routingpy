**routingpy** is a Python 3 client for a lot of popular web routing services.

Using **routingpy** you can easily request **directions**, **isochrones** and
**matrices** from many reliable online providers in a consistent fashion. Base parameters
are the same for all services, while still preserving each service's special parameters (for
more info, please look at our `README`_.
Take a look at our `Examples`_ to see how simple you can compare routes from different providers.

**routingpy** is tested against 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 :strike:`and PyPy3` (`#60 <https://github.com/gis-ops/routing-py/issues/60>`_).
