## Jupyter Notebook examples

We created a small collection of notebook examples to show the basic (and more advanced) usage of **routingpy**.

This collection is also available as out-of-the-box interactive notebooks on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gis-ops/routing-py/master?filepath=examples).
